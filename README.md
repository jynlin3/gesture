# Online Guesstures Game with multiple players
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
See [Demo](https://www.seattle8520.xyz/)

**Important Note:**
It has been directly merged reusing most of the code from the Janus video room [demo](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/master/html/videoroomtest.js), including jQuery!
